# Code-Quiz

## Description

code-quiz is a quiz that also records your record after you finish the quiz and then allows you to then do the quiz again.

## Getting Started

Given the objective of the quiz I researched the topic and added my own spin on the actual css to make the quiz look like my own. Then I researched and used the lessons on api's and dom minupulation to create the proper java script to complete the task at hand
